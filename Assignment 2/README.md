# Assignment 2

## Tasks
1. Analyze conceptually the requirements for a singly linked list in C++ and create a class which implements all the required functions. Write code for insertion and deletion of a node in a singly linked list (at start, middle and end positions).  
2. Write a SortedINSERT() function which given a sorted list in ascending order, and a single node, inserts the node into the correct sorted position in the list. 
3. Create a method that takes two linked lists as arguments and appends second list to the first one. 
4. Create SORT() method that sorts a given list in ascending order. 
5. Create SPLIT() method that splits a given list into two parts i.e. front part and back part. For cases where no. of elements is odd, the second part should hold the extra element.
